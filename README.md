Simon Game!

The Classic Memory Game of memorizing patterns with added difficulty levels

MOTIVATION:
This was a school project that was meant to utilize the development tools that we have studied thus far in the course.  Languages used in this project consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

Build Status:
For the most part, this build is complete.  There are always extra design features that could be implemented, and if they're cool and contribute to the overall user experience in the game, then of course they can be merged.  At this point, there are two areas that would likely be considered.  Overall layout and UI/UX and a known logical flaw exposure.  See KNOWN ISSUES.

TECH USED:
This program is meant to run on most browsers.  As it is, it should run on all the known popular browsers with modern updates.  Programming languages used are:
    - HTML
    - CSS 
    - JavaScript

INSTALLATION: 
No installation is required at this point, the program should be able to be forked, copied, and run on your local machine on a browser.
